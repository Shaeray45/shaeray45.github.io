Hey Everyone! Thank you for coming to my site! I wanted to be able to discuss the topic about prisons and the negative impact they have on our society and most importantly the prisoners. Shinning light on this topic is very important to me. I have a story and it is still writing itself until this day. The fight is not over! 
<p>Hereâ€™s a snippet of my story: My father is serving life in prison for a crime he did NOT commit. The evidence the police has against my dad is not accurate nor does it match what allegedly happen. I am now 24 years old, and for as long as I remember I only saw my father behind bars. We have high hopes that one day he will be able to come home to his loved ones, live normal not like an animal. We are still fighting! His prison conditions are awful! Their protocols for COVID is not working and they blame the prisoners instead of the correctional officers who are they only ones entering and exiting the jails. I pray he is safe every day and keeps a healthy mindset. Information and help from Prison Perform movements give me hope. I just hope it spread through out all the jail systems.
