<p>News articles: The Impact of Prison Reform</p>

<p>A news article posted on The Washington Post stated "The American criminal justice system’s gradual realization that too many people are 
  in jail needlessly just got a large, visible boost from the city of Philadelphia. The city announced last week that it would close its notorious 
  91-year-old House of Correction jail because reforms begun two years ago have dropped the city’s jail population by 33 percent, without 
  causing any increase in crime or chaos. (Jackman, 2018)</p>
