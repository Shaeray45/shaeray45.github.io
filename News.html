<h2>News articles: The Impact of Prison Reform</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/true-crime/wp/2018/04/23/justice-reforms-take-hold-the-inmate-population-plummets-and-philadelphia-closes-a-notorious-jail">
  A news article posted on The Washington Post</a> stated 
  "The American criminal justice system’s gradual realization that too many people are 
  in jail needlessly just got a large, visible boost from the city of Philadelphia. The city announced last week that it would close its notorious 
  91-year-old House of Correction jail because reforms begun two years ago have dropped the city’s jail population by 33 percent, without 
  causing any increase in crime or chaos. (Jackman, 2018)</p>

<h2>News Articles:SHOT BY POLICE, THEN CONVICTED IN A MURDER HE SAYS HE DIDN’T COMMIT. NOW HE’S FACING COVID-19 BEHIND BARS.</h2>

<p>I would like to share this piece from the article. Many of us can relate to some one being in prison for a crime they did not commit.
  It saddens my heart to know someone is being punished for a crime they did not commit. Not even that, they have all the evidence to back their story
  up or worst, NO evidence t prove they commited the crime.</p>
</p>Stated in the article .... "Although her fears about Keith are new, Kelly has been a fearless advocate for Keith and his highly 
  unusual case for nearly five years. In 2015, Keith was shot by Baltimore police officers, then later charged in an unrelated murder 
  and tried four times. Last year, Keith was convicted of second-degree murder.  At Keith’s sentencing in March, he was hit with a 50-year prison term. 
  Now he says he is especially vulnerable to COVID-19 at MRDCC because he has respiratory issues stemming from when the police shot him."</p>

<h2>The Doors Don't Lock in DC Jail</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.justicepolicy.org/news/12998"> A news article posted on Justice Policy</a>
  Here is another article I found that shares experiences of prisoners while being locked up at this facility. A positive outcome this jail had on its prisoners:</p> 
 <p>‘The Doors Don’t Lock’ in DC Jail Program for Young Adults. Published by Michael Gelb, October 5, 2020</p>
<p>“Tyrone Walker, a former YME mentor and one of the report’s authors, told The Crime Report that unlike in the rest of the Washington, D.C. jail, 
  “the doors don’t lock on the YME.”</p>
<p>This meant that “our mentees had 24/7 access to us. Even in the middle of the night, mentees had bad dreams…because of being traumatized early on in life.
  They would knock on our door. We talked to young men at 2:30 in the morning.”</p>
<p>The report, believed to be the first of its kind to be authored by currently and formerly incarcerated individuals, was also written by Michael Woody and Joel Castón, 
  both of whom remain incarcerated. Walker is now an associate at JPI.”</p>
